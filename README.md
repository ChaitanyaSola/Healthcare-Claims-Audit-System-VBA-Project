ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement: Healthcare Claims Audit System
The healthcare industry faces significant financial challenges due to inaccurate billing, fraudulent claims, and payment errors. Insurance companies and healthcare payers often struggle to ensure that claims are processed accurately and that payments are aligned with billed services.

This project presents a simplified Healthcare Claims Audit System built using Microsoft Access to simulate a real-world solution for managing and auditing healthcare claims. The goal is to:

Track patient information and submitted treatment claims

Monitor payments made to healthcare providers

Detect overpayments or underpayments through automated queries

Record and manage audit findings for flagged claims

Generate reports that provide insights into monthly claim activity, common error types, and top providers with overpayments

By modeling this system with relational tables, queries, and reports, the project demonstrates how data management and analysis can support better financial oversight and reduce waste and errors in healthcare payments.
